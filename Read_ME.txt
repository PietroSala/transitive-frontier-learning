
## Transitive_frontier_learning

This script is designed to implement a Transitive frontier learning process. An example can be found in the 
'Transitive_Frontier_Learning_example' based on the Air quality dataset. You can find the dataset on: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality
We first show how we processed the dataset, then how to perform the analysis.
In the 'processingData_Example' directory there are some example of analysis and how the data have been processed.
